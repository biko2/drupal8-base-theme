## Paragraph

```example
<p>A paragraph (from the Greek paragraphos, "to write beside" or "written beside") is a self-contained unit of a discourse in writing dealing with a particular point or idea. A paragraph consists of one or more sentences. Though not required by the syntax of any language, paragraphs are usually an expected part of formal writing, used to organize longer prose.</p>
```

```example
<p><a href="#">This is a text link</a></p>

<p><strong>Strong is used to indicate strong importance</strong></p>

<p>The <em>em element</em> is text that is set off from the normal text</p>

<p>The <u>u element</u> is text with an unarticulated, though explicitly rendered, non-textual annotation</p>

<p><del>This text is deleted</del> and <ins>This text is inserted</ins></p>

<p><small>This small text is small for for fine print, etc.</small></p>

<p><s>This text has a strikethrough</s></p>

<p><q cite="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/HTML/Element/q">This text is a short inline quotation</q></p>

<p><cite>This is a citation</cite>
```

## Blockquote

```example
<blockquote> <p>A block quotation (also known as a long quotation or extract) is a quotation in a written document, that is set off from the main text as a paragraph, or block of text, and typically distinguished visually using indentation and a different typeface or smaller size quotation.</p> </blockquote>
```

## HR

## Unordered list
```example
<ul>
  <li>This is a list item in an unordered list</li>
  <li>An unordered list is a list in which the sequence of items is not important. Sometimes, an unordered list is a bulleted list. And this is a long list item in an unordered list that can wrap onto a new line. </li>
  <li>
    Lists can be nested inside of each other
    <ul>
      <li>This is a nested list item</li>
      <li>This is another nested list item in an unordered list</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>This is the last list item</li>
</ul>
```

## Ordered list
```example
<ol>
  <li>This is a list item in an ordered list</li>
  <li>An ordered list is a list in which the sequence of items is important. An ordered list does not necessarily contain sequence characters.</li>
  <li>
    Lists can be nested inside of each other
    <ol>
      <li>This is a nested list item</li>
      <li>This is another nested list item in an ordered list</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>This is the last list item</li>
</ol>
```

## Definition list
```example
<dl>
  <dt>Definition List</dt>
  <dd>A number of connected items or names written or printed consecutively, typically one below the other.</dd>
  <dt>This is a term.</dt>
  <dd>This is the definition of that term, which both live in a <code>dl</code>.</dd>
  <dt>Here is another term.</dt>
  <dd>And it gets a definition too, which is this line.</dd>
  <dt>Here is term that shares a definition with the term below.</dt>
  <dd>And it gets a definition too, which is this line.</dd>
</dl>
```

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Table Heading 1</th>
      <th>Table Heading 2</th>
      <th>Table Heading 3</th>
      <th>Table Heading 4</th>
